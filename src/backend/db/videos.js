      "A FEW IMPORTANT NOTES: 1: At the end I said cooling is not required. I went off script here, I meant to say additional cooling. Any fans your CPU or case comes with are most certainly required. 2: A GPU is technically a component within the Graphics card (CPU is to Computer as GPU is to Graphics card) but if you're thinking about building a computer the terms are used interchangably. Every graphics card comes with a GPU inside of it and they are often referred to as GPU because that is the defining characteristic of a graphics card. 3: Solid State Drives are the same thing as hard drives, just with less space and faster speed due to the lack of spinning disks. 4: A GPU is technically not an *essential* part of a computer. You can boot without it. But to do almost anything desktop computers are good for, you will need a grahpics card.",
